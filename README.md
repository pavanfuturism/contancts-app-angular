# contancts-app-angular
Clone angular using "https://github.com/pavanfuturism/contancts-app-angular.git"

I have used below versions for Angular
Node Version: 20.10.0
Angular Version: 17.0.3

If you don't have angular/node js install in system please follow the below steps
1. Install node js from "https://nodejs.org/en/download"
2. After installation of Node Js install angular using "npm install -g @angular/cli"
3. After installation of Angular open CMD & change your directory using "cd <directorypath>"
4. Once your directory is changes in CMD, enter "npm install" to install all packages.
5. Check API is running or not, if not, then make .Net project run, copy the URL and paste in Enviornment/enviornment.ts file, replace the value in "baseUrl" key.
6. Now you can enter "ng serve" command to run your application, it will be hosted on localhost:4200
7. Enter localhost:4200 in your browser
